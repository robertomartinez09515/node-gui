# About React NodeGUI

[React NodeGUI](https://github.com/nodegui/react-nodegui) is an open source library for building cross-platform desktop applications with React and CSS like styling. React NodeGUI is a custom react renderer for [NodeGui](https://github.com/nodegui/nodegui). React NodeGUI combines the power and flexibility of React with ease of NodeJs and maturity of Qt5. With React NodeGUI you can build native desktop applications which are underneath Qt applications. This means you could in theory use all of Qt's Gui APIs in Javascript.

As React Native was an improvement over Cordova based applications in Mobile app development with web technologies, React NodeGUI aims to achieve the same with respect to Electron and other chromium based cross platform Gui solutions. React NodeGUI wants to incorporate everything that is good about Electron: The ease of development, freedom of styling, Native APIs, great documentation, etc. At the same time it aims to be memory and CPU efficient.

Also, React NodeGUI (like NodeGui) is built with Typescript which means you get autocomplete and strong typechecking support from the IDE even when used in a Javascript project.

Get started building with React NodeGUI in the [First React NodeGUI app](react/first-app.md).
