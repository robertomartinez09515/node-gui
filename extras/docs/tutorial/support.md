# NodeGui Support

## Finding Support

If you're looking for programming help or for answers to questions please file an issue on the NodeGui's Github project issues and we will try our best to answer and help out.

## Supported Platforms

Following platforms are supported by NodeGui:

### macOS

Only 64bit binaries are provided for macOS, and the minimum macOS version
supported is macOS 10.10 (Yosemite).

### Windows

Windows 7 and later are supported, older operating systems are not supported
(and might not work).

Only `x64` (`amd64`) binaries are provided for Windows at this point of time.

### Linux

The prebuilt `x64` (`amd64`) binaries of NodeGui are built on Ubuntu 12.04.

Whether the prebuilt binary can run on a distribution depends on whether the
distribution includes the libraries that NodeGui is linked to on the building
platform, so only Ubuntu 12.04 is guaranteed to work, but following platforms
are also verified to be able to run the prebuilt binaries of NodeGui:

- Ubuntu 12.04 and newer
- Fedora 21
- Debian 8
